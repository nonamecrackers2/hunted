	"hunted.game.description": "Hunted is a multiplayer horror minigame where “Prey” have to collect Keys hidden randomly around a map while evading murder at the hands of the “Hunter”. The goal of the Prey is to collect all of the Keys and escape through a gate, while the goal of the Hunter is to kill the Prey before they can flee. To assist in their escape, the Prey can select between a few classes each with their own unique ability.\n\nHidden throughout the map are buttons which may have Keys, but can also contain Curses that inhibit the Prey, or perhaps nothing at all. While the locations of the buttons are not random, the positions of the Keys and Curses will change each round.\n\nThe gates will unlock once the Prey deposit all of the Keys in the keyholes around the gates using right-click. Keys may be deposited at any point in the round, though the gate will only unlock when they are all in place. Once all Keys are deposited and the gate is open, any Prey who runs through it will have successfully escaped.\n\nTo join a game, select your prey and Hunter class in the next tab, then in the tab over join a game. Only the VIP (the first person who joined) can select maps, button highlighting, etc. Button highlighting (the button to the right of the ‘Begin’ button) is meant to get familiar with a map, by highlighting nearby buttons. After playing with it for a few rounds, it’s recommended to disable it and try without highlighting. Good luck!",
